<h3> Introduction to Indian Politics </h3>
<br/>
<p>
Mahatma Gandhi stated about the place of ethics in politics. He told that politics without ethics and principles were not desirable. 
The principles are the moral principles. 
According to his philosophy political, life should be governed by truth, morality and self-purification. 
Gandhiji’s politics were bound up with truth and non-violence. He also prescribed that country should concern with the morals of her leaders. 
Devotion to truth was drawn by him to half corruption. He had no intention to indulge the religious matter. 
He interpreted that religious matter is a death-trap because it kills the soul.
He also expressed that “For me there is no politics without religion, not the religion of the superstitions or the blind religion that hates and fights, but the universal religion of toleration”.
Politics is that field in which many of the politician members takes part for the welfare of the democratic countries.
</p>

<p>
The politician member’s selections are depending on the vote of people and when many of the votes will go for one particular party, those have elected for the vote of the public.
For a better form of government an strong opposition is needed. 
If the opposition will not strong then, the elected government will commit many types of mistakes and take wrong decisions. 
That is why opposition is needed to stop/oppose these things. </p>
<p>
Politics in India take place within the framework of its constitution, because India is a federal parliamentary democratic republic, in which the President of India is the head of country and the Prime Minister of India is the head of the government. 
India follows the dual polity system, i.e. a double government which consists of the central authority at the center and states at the periphery. 
The constitution defines the organization powers and limitations of both central and state governments, and it is well-recognized, rigid and considered supreme; i.e. laws of the nation must conform to it.
</p>
<p>
There is a provision for a bicameral legislature consisting of an Upper House, i.e. Rajya Sabha, which represents the states of the Indian federation and a Lower House i.e. Lok Sabha, which represents the people of India as a whole. The Indian constitution provides for an independent judiciary, which is headed by the Supreme Court. 
The court's mandate is to protect the constitution, to settle disputes between the central government and the states, to settle inter-state disputes, to nullify any central or state laws that go against the constitution, and to protect the fundamental rights of citizens, issuing writs for their enforcement in cases of violation
</P>
<p>
Governments are formed through elections held every five years (unless otherwise specified), by parties that secure a majority of members in their respective lower houses (Lok Sabha in the central government and Vidhan Sabha in states).</div>
